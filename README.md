# Leveling-up your Survey Data: A hands-on approach to visualizing survey data with Tableau

These days, data is all around us – and each day more data is created than we can effectively use. Student surveys is one of those important data points that highlight your students’ voices. In this hands-on session, participants will work through a sample dataset to build effective survey visualizations. We will connect practitioners with a tool that allows them to streamline their data processing so they can spend more time analyzing and presenting data In the session, there will be a review of example visualizations and dashboards so participants may learn how to build them in Tableau. Participants are encouraged to follow along at home, as they will walk away from the presentation with a visualization and dashboard that they man connect to their own institution’s survey data. 

- Participants will understand the process of building a visualization in Tableau
- Participants will be able to apply the foundations of effective dashboards to their own institution’s survey dataset
